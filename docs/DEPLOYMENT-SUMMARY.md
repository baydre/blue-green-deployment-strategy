make req-green   # Direct to green
```

### Test Script Features

`local-test.sh` provides:
- ✅ Pre-flight checks (Docker, files, config)
- ✅ Automated image building
- ✅ Stack deployment and health verification
- ✅ Baseline connectivity tests
- ✅ Automated failover verification
- ✅ Chaos mode testing
- ✅ Health endpoint validation
- ✅ Docker healthcheck verification
- ✅ Detailed logging to timestamped files
- ✅ HTML test report generation
- ✅ Automatic cleanup (optional --keep-running)

```bash
# Usage options
./local-test.sh                # Full test suite
./local-test.sh --skip-build   # Skip image building
./local-test.sh --keep-running # Don't tear down after tests
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/verify-failover.yml`

**Features**:
- ✅ Matrix testing (tests both ACTIVE_POOL=blue and ACTIVE_POOL=green)
- ✅ Automated image building
- ✅ Health check verification
- ✅ Failover verification
- ✅ Performance benchmarking (Apache Bench)
- ✅ Failover time measurement
- ✅ Artifact upload (logs, benchmarks)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Matrix Strategy**:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    active_pool: [blue, green]
  fail-fast: false
```

This ensures the system works correctly regardless of which pool is active.

```

## 🏭 Production Deployment

### Pre-Production Checklist

- [ ] Build and push images to container registry
- [ ] Update `.env.production` with registry image references
- [ ] Configure TLS certificates
- [ ] Set up secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- [ ] Configure resource limits in `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Test rollback procedures
- [ ] Document runbook for on-call team

### Deployment Process

```bash
# 1. Build and push images
docker build -t registry.example.com/myapp:v2.0.0 ./app
docker push registry.example.com/myapp:v2.0.0

# 2. Deploy to inactive pool (Green)
export GREEN_IMAGE=registry.example.com/myapp:v2.0.0
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d app_green

# 3. Health check
curl -f http://green-internal/health

# 4. Switch traffic
make pool-toggle

# 5. Monitor for 5-10 minutes
watch -n 5 'curl -s http://localhost:8080/ | grep X-App-Pool'

# 6. Update Blue with new version
export BLUE_IMAGE=registry.example.com/myapp:v2.0.0
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d app_blue
```

### Production Features

**`docker-compose.prod.yml` includes**:
- ✅ No direct app port exposure (security)
- ✅ Resource limits (CPU, memory)
- ✅ Tuned health checks
- ✅ Log rotation configuration
- ✅ Restart policies
- ✅ TLS certificate mounting
- ✅ Production environment variables

**PRODUCTION.md covers**:
- ✅ Environment-specific configuration
- ✅ Secrets management strategies
- ✅ TLS/HTTPS setup (Let's Encrypt, custom certs)
- ✅ Security hardening (headers, rate limiting, non-root)
- ✅ Resource management and scaling
- ✅ Monitoring and observability
- ✅ Disaster recovery procedures
- ✅ Backup strategies

### Rollback Procedure

**Automated rollback** with `rollback.sh`:

```bash
# Automatic rollback to inactive pool
./rollback.sh

# Rollback to specific pool
./rollback.sh --to=blue

# Force rollback (skip health checks)
./rollback.sh --force
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Pre-rollback health checks
- ✅ Safety confirmation prompt
- ✅ Automated pool switching
- ✅ Post-rollback validation
- ✅ Test request verification
- ✅ Detailed rollback report generation
- ✅ Clear success/failure messaging

**Manual rollback**:
```bash
make pool-toggle  # Quick toggle
# or
make pool-blue    # Explicit pool selection
```

## 📊 Testing Coverage
